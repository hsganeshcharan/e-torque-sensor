Motor Control Loop:

Connect to a 250W BLDC motor for an e-bike by using the rider's pedal speed and real-time data from an MPU-6050 sensor. Based on the determined pedal speed, motor speed, and torque demand, the motor control system modifies motor speed and offers torque assistance.

*Real-Time Motor Speed Adjustment: Adjust motor speed to match pedal speed, ensuring smooth and efficient assistance to the rider.
*Torque Assistance: Provides proportional motor torque to assist the rider, based on the difference between pedal and motor speed.
*PWM Motor Control: Controls the BLDC motor via PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to vary the motor speed using a 12V battery system.
*Feedback Mechanism: Dynamically adjusts motor power to optimize performance based on real-time rider input.

Library/ Pre-req:
	Raspberry Pi or ESP32 (for control and data processing)
	Python (with libraries such as RPi.GPIO for PWM control, matplotlib for plotting, and scipy for data filtering)
	Django (for web interface and API if applicable)
