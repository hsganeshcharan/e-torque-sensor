Battery Health monitoring with Machine learning:

I have built a Battery Health Monitoring System that uses machine learning (ML) to predict battery health, communicates via RESTful API, and incorporates data structures and concurrency for efficient handling of data.

OVERVIEW
*Battery Data Collection: Collect battery-related data such as voltage, temperature, and charge/discharge cycles from an IoT sensor or hardware.
*Machine Learning: A simple ML model (e.g., linear regression or random forest) to predict the battery's health or life expectancy based on historical data.
*RESTful API: Use Flask to expose the data and predictions via a RESTful API for easy interaction.
*Concurrency: Use multi-threading or asynchronous programming to collect and process data concurrently to handle multiple requests or real-time sensor data.

library Pre-req
*Flask for the API
*Scikit-learn for the ML model
*NumPy for numerical operations
*Threading/AsyncIO for concurrency

**NOTE:** 
Flask Routes:

/predict_battery_health: This endpoint predicts battery health using the latest data collected by the sensor and the trained linear regression model.
/battery_data: Returns the latest collected data as a JSON response.
